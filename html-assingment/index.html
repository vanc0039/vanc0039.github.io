            I started taking photos of my friends a few years ago which led me to other creative outlets but photography took off very quickly and people started asking me to do photographs for their brands. I loved making images for clients but I always wanted to have more of a say on how my images will be used in marketing. So I started this program to expand my skillset and understanding so I can not only take the photographs but I could also then design graphics to compliment my work. On the side I always worked in hospitality. My creative work as a photographer and my love for entertaining my guests in a restaurant has led me to my latest hobby, drag. I started doing drag over quarantine and my plan is to become a drag performer and maybe one day compete on RuPauls drag race. My end career goal is undecided but I know this program will benefit me in more ways than one.
